## Challenge:

The objective of the project to be carried out (My Business), is to control inventory and money flow according to the purchases and sales that are made there, in addition to this being done through a graphical interface that is very easy to understand for any user. Username.

This project will not have a tax control (VAT, declaration and others), since for time only a net flow of inputs and outputs will be presented.

This is aimed at owners of small stores, minimarkets, among others.

## Infrastructure:

Initially it will work with a main branch on Github.
Each member will develop code in turn with the support of the team and will push once each proposed objective has been achieved.
The application will receive data through different requests (post, get…) this through flask-MySQLdb.
unit testing
